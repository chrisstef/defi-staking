## Summary ‚ö°

A decentralize finance app built with Ganache, Solidity &amp; React.
Deployed on the folllowing test networks:
- **[Stardust](https://stardust-explorer.metis.io/)**
- **[Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)**
- **[Meter](https://scan-warringstakes.meter.io/)**
- **[Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/#stats)**



The dapp allows us to:

- `stakeTokens`: Add a token to the farming contract for yield farming.

- `unStakeTokens`: Remove tokens from the staking contract.

- `claimTokens`: Mint mock USDT required for staking.

- `issueTokens`: Issue a reward to the users who are staking.


For the above interactions with the blockchain, we created 3 smart contracts namely:

- `RWD` : A reward token(RWD), which is being airdropped to the staking addresses.

- `Tether` : A mock Tether stablecoin(mUSDT), which will be used for staking and trigger the above functionality.

- `DecentralBank` : DecentralBank which serves as a decentralized bank, where both tokens 

   have been initially transfered and will use upgraded logic to handle the operations.
   
The total supply of `RWD` and `mUSDT` is 1M tokens and they are located in the `Decentralbank` address.

## Usage ‚õì

You need to have **[Metamask](https://metamask.io/)** installed and make sure you are connected to one of the following networks:

- **[Stardust](https://stardust-explorer.metis.io/)**
- **[Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/)**
- **[Meter](https://scan-warringstakes.meter.io/)**
- **[Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/#stats)**

To add a network, I would personally recommend to read through this page: **[Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/)**

After you succesfully connect, mint some free USDT and stake it. The airdrop will occur every 1 min.

Patiently wait between transactions and refresh the page after every interaction with the blockchain in order to update the frontend(if needed).

**(Note: to prevent crashing, USDT amount staked should be less than 60. The app serves as a demonstration of yield farming after all).**

## Tests ‚ö†


Truffle suite is ideal for testing our smart contracts. 

The subfoloder `test`, contains custom tests I wrote such as:

- Names of the contracts match before and after deployment.
- DecentralBank is being sent the tokens during the initial Migration.
- DecentralBank functionalities are working properly. And more..
